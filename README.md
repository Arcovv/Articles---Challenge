# Articles---Challenge

## First, I want to declare: It's an iOS project using Swift, but I use some Local HTML files so maybe Github thinks it's a HTML type.

OK, let's begin.

## The Process

This challenge asks me to using some HTML files when loading WKWebView. 

* First, using `NSBundle.mainBundle().pathForResource(_, ofType: _)` to get the file path. 
* Second, using `String(contentsOfFile: _, encoding: NSUTF8StringEncoding)` to get the HTML string.
* I'm not familiar with HTML/JS/CSS and other web programming languages. Acturally, I haven't written any web programming language before, so just went to [w3school](http://www.w3schools.com) and used when just learned. For convenience, I modified the lengthy script and add them by myself:

``` swift
var html = "<html>"
	html += "<head>"
	html += "<style>"
	html += "body { font-size: 18px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-height: \(height)px; height: \(height)px; max-width: \(width)px; -webkit-column-width: \(width)px; -webkit-column-gap: 0px; }"
	// html += "#container { height: \(height)px; -webkit-column-width: \(width)px; -webkit-column-gap: 50px; background-color: yellow; }"
	html += "</style>"
	html += "</head>"
	html += "<body>"
	//html += "<div id=\"container\">"
	html += loadHTMLString
	//html += "</div>"
	html += "</body>"
	html += "</html>"
```

In above, I think the most thing are 
1. `max-height: \(height)px;` 
2. `height: \(height)px;` 
3. `max-width: \(width)px;` 
4. `-webkit-column-width: \(width)px;`
5. `margin: 0px;`
   
If you're not familiar with these, you will get puzzled and crazy all day. üòÇ

Do more practise about them!

Then, using `loadHTMLString(_, baseURL: _)` and enjoy!

> Sometime I think, alternative is using `webView.configuration.userContentController.addUserScript(script)` and `webView.configuration.userContentController.addScriptMessageHandler(self, name: "observe")` to inject Our script then follow `WKScriptMessageHandler` protocol to get the body text. At last show them in UILabel and UIScrollView or something... This will be more easily to page the article using animation like reading book. Maybe I will implement this in one day. You can see my method in `webViewScriptSetUp()` and comment in `WKScriptMessageHandler` protocol. Print it and you will get what I want.


* Care about UIScrollView in WkWebView and delegate UIScrollViewDelegate by `self`. You also must set `delegate = nil` when you out of the view controller, or you will get crash every time. 
* Use your Logic and add more gestures in scrollView. I implement when use tapping in 20% width left or right rect, the article will *paging*. Be care and should implement one `UIGestureRecognizerDelegate`. See more at line 222.
* I use a `PageLogic` class to help me calculate the page index in every article. And use ErrorType to throw and catch error. I also use singleton pattern and it's really interested.
* KVO is really useful and I use it to observe the file loading status and what is the current page. Not to forget remove them in deinit.

This challenge gave me a revelation, which reminded me I should read and practice more iOS Fundation frameworks. It alse notice me I shoulf learn more programming languages.

### **A long and long road, but a Passionate and Challenging future.**

Thanks for your reading.
